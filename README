IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

For route HTTP requests to handlers was used Netty-Router combining with
implemented processRequest method of HttpHandler interface in each handler.

To delay response on /hello route different group of executors was used.
Delaying is performed via 'schedule' method of ChannelContext's executor.

Redirect is just HTTP Found response with custom LOCATION header.

Statistics was done using  PerChannelStatisticHandler object,
which delegate data from each request to StatServise, where situated
and are filled with needed collections.
PerChannelStatisticHandler also extends ChannelTrafficShapingHandler,
 which give good functionality for measuring channel traffic.

View was done with help of Mustache web template system.
